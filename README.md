# TrueSelf-ChatBot
AI Chatbot build with NEXT.js, React &amp; OpenAI API

Welcome to my personal AI chatbot project, built with **Next.js**, **React**, and the **OpenAI API**. This project serves as a learning example of how to build a secure and scalable web application with an AI backend.

The project is structured with a German codebase, but this README provides all the necessary information in English for a broader audience.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Secure API Communication**: The OpenAI API key is handled on the server side using a Next.js API route to prevent it from being exposed in the frontend code.
- **Context-Aware Conversation**: The application sends the entire conversation history to the AI, allowing it to maintain the context of the dialogue.
- **Clean UI**: A simple, clean user interface ensures a smooth user experience.
- **Easy Setup**: The project is designed for quick configuration and local startup.
